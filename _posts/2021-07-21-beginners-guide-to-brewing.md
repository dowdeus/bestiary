### Introduction

Brewing is similiar to alchemy, however we have no intrest in mixing alchemical forumals. Instead brewing is a mixture of art, philosophy, and senses. A good brewer knows to approach their craft with a simple attitude; we believed that smell, texture, and flavour is necessary to pursue the brewers quest successfully.


At the heart of brewing is the idea that all good recipies are composed of good quality ingredients however one key ingredient is hops. Something you will learn to balance out with the flavour you add to your brews.

Here we have included some simple recipes to get you started, common beers known as suldfire ale and Clare's household Strong Ale.


### Materials
1. Grains

The most common grain in ale and beer is malted barley. Wheat is also fairly common, often in smaller quantities, as are oats.

Dredge is a combination of oats and barley. A quarter is a unit of dry measure of approximately 290 liters; there are 8 bushels to the quarter, making a quarter approx. 36 1/4 liters.


2. Yeast

Though there have been some reports of successfully culturing yeast from bottles of beer found in ship-wrecks, none of these cultures have become commercially available to the homebrewer. Failing authentic yeast, I opted to combine two strains of modern yeast of the types used to make modern Empire ales.

Combine some of your wort (presumably cool enough) with some barm (yeast), and let these work while the main batch is cooling. Then when the main batch is cool, stir up this starter well and mix it in. The cooling time can be quite substantial, much more than an hour or two.
Using a starter is good practice. Starting with a large quantity of yeast will reduce the effects of wild yeasts and other microorganisms by overwhelming them by sheer number, and by eating up all the available sugar. This will help keep the ale from catching unwanted infections, since there will be less for undesirable microbes to feed on.

3. Water

Many breweries in the Empire generally had fairly hard water so you shouldnt need to alter the mineral content of the local water for these brews.

4. Oak

Beers and ales are usually tunned in casks, often made of oak. This addes to the flavor and is recommended.

### Techniques
1. Crushing the grain

In order to allow hot water to get at the starches in the grains, the grain must be crushed. It should not be powdered into a flour, however, as this can lead to a big sticky mess that one cannot get any liquid back out of. Ideally then, each grain should be crushed into two or three pieces, hopefully without ripping up the husk too much, as doing so will allow too much tannin to get into the liquid.


2. Mashing

Mashing is the process of converting the starches in the grains into fermentable sugars, using the enzymes that are in the malted grain. After being crushed (lightly ground), the grain is mixed with hot water, and held in this temperature range for an hour or three. During this time, the enzymes will convert almost all of the starches into simple sugars that the yeast can digest.

3. Infusion mashing

The infusion technique is the predominate method used by the Empire. This is a very simple technique: grains are crushed into few pieces (each) to expose the partially modified starch kernels. Then these are mixed with hot water to the consistency of medium-thick porridge. Then this is allowed to sit for between one and three hours. During this time, enzymes in the grain convert the starch into sugars. Finally, the liquid would be drained away from the grain solids.

4. A second running

The general mashing technique used by Empire brewers is double (or triple) infusion mashing. In this, after the first infusion has been done (as described above) and the liquor has been drained off, a second batch of hot water is added to the grains, which are again allowed to steep. The second batch of liquor is then drained off and fermented. For very potent beers or ales, a third running would be performed in the same way.

5. Cooling

The cooling technique involves pouring the hot wort into a shallow open vat. Another popular method is to let the wort cool by just sitting, closed, over night.

6. Fermenting

To ferment use 3- or 4-gallon plastic fermenters, either with a lid that does not quite seal or with a plastic bubble-lock. I kept them closed to prevent possible infection, though that doesn't seem to matter with the addition of the Lambic dregs.

### Recipe 1: Suldfire Ale

| Ingredients |
|---|
| 4 2/3 lbs., Hugh Baird brand Empire Pale malt |
| 1 1/2 lbs., oats (rolled) |
| 13 qts., water |
| 1 pkt, Danstar brand Norsimit ale yeast |
| 1 pkt, Danstar brand Silver ale yeast |
| 1/4 oz., Light Oak chips |

Sanitize an insulated tun, and a fermentation vessel. Also sanitize a strainer if needed to separate liquid from grain.

Boil water. Crush the malt, then mix it well, while still dry, with the oats.

Open up the insulated tun and place it on the floor near the stove. Pour 2 quarts of water into the tun from a reasonable height, moderately slowly.

Pour all the dry grain into the lauter tun.

Slowly pour 3 more quarts of boiling water over the grain. Don't stir. Put the cover on the tun and let it stand for 10 mins. Then add 1 more quart of boiling water. At this point, there should be a very small amount of visible liquid. Put the lid back on and wait 20 more mins.

Now take the lid off and stir it all up. It should be about the consistency of fairly thick porridge. Put the lid back on and do something else for a while -- at least an hour and a half.

Open up the tun and stir in 3 more quarts of boiling water, and stir. Close up again and wait 25 more mins.

Finally, add remaining boiling water. Stir well.

Set up the sanitized fermenter. Open the mash tun valve (or otherwise start straining out the wort, that is the liquid part, from the grain. The first gallon should go quickly; straining the last gallon should be done somewhat more slowly in order to get most of the liquid out.

Close the fermenter and let the wort cool overnight.

Rehydrate both packages of yeast according to the package instructions (being careful to use water that has been boiled and cooled, and a vase that has been sanitized in some way). Pitch the yeast into the wort, and shake, stir, and otherwise agitate the wort in order to aerate it.

Let the ale ferment for a day; the yeast should have started, and activity should be well under way. Boil the oak chips in approx. 1 cup water. When the water is the color of a cup of tea, take off heat and allow to cool some. Pour off water, then add approx. 1/2 cup of water back into chips. Raise this to a boil again, then allow to cool; it should be just barely darker in color than normal water. Add this oak-water to the wort.

Let the ale ferment for a couple more days. Draw off and serve.

### Recipe 1: Clare's household Strong Ale

| Ingredients |
|---|
| 8 lbs., Hugh Baird brand Empire Pale malt |
| 1 1/3 lbs., Pale malt, roasted. |
| around 3 lbs., oats (rolled) |
| 14 to 16 qts., water (main batch) |
| 6 to 8 qts., water (second runnings)|
| 1 pkt, Danstar brand Norsimit ale yeast |
| 1 pkt, Danstar brand Silver ale yeast |

Pre-heat the furnace. Measure out 1 1/3 lbs. of pale malt, and place it in a pan. When the furnace is hot, place the malt in the furnace and bake for 30 mins. Then increase the heat and bake another 30 mins. Or, for a lighter colored ale, simply bake 60 mins. at hot. Remove and set out to cool.

Sanitize an insulated tun, and two fermentation vessels.

Boil water for first runnings (14 to 16 qts.). Crush the malt, mixing the amber (baked) malt with the pale malt. Then mix the oats with the crushed malt well.

If your tun has a false bottom or other similar device, pour in enough boiling water to cover it. Then pour in all of the grain. Finally, slowly ladle the remaining water over the grain, pouring from some height.

Cover the mash tun and let sit 30 mins. Open and stir well, then close and let sit another 3 1/2 to 4 hours. This is a hot mash, so it will need this long period of time to mash (convert the starches into sugars).

Put the water for the second running on to boil. Set up the first fermentation vessel under the drain valve or tube of the insulated tun, and slowly run the liquor from the first mash into the first vessel. Close and set aside to cool.

After the first liquor has been drained out, and when the water for the second running has reached a boil, pour it into the damp grain. Allow to sit for 30 mins, then set up the second fermentation vessel and run this liquor into it. Close the second fermenter, and allow both to cool overnight.

In the morning, sanitize a smaller pan or ladle, cup, and a spoon. Also boil about a cup of water and cool it, covered. Rehydrate the packets of yeast into 3/4 cup of the boiled water. Pour this yeast mixture into the two fermenters, 2/3 into the strong main batch, 1/3 into the second runnings. Use the sanitized ladle to aerate each of the batches (by picking up liquor and pouring it back in turbulently).

Close the fermenters (filling the water locks, if any) and allow to ferment.


The rest is up to you, good luck. There are some good books you can buy however the art of this craft should be up to you.
