### Introduction

Alchemy is a mixture of science, philosophy, and mysticism. A good alchemists knows to approach their craft with a holistic attitude; we believed that purity of mind, body, and spirit is necessary to pursue the alchemical quest successfully.


At the heart of alchemy is the idea that all matter is composed of four elements: earth, air, fire, and water. With the right combination of elements, it has been theorized, any substance on this plain might be formed.

Alchemy is just as much art as science, and well known practitioners preserved their secrets with an obfuscating system of symbols and mysterious names for the materials they studied.

However, we can deduce common tounge names for various flowers, herbs and mixtures. It does sometimes take time to find things that work, although there are recorded basic recipes alchemy is art and requires the most purified being to create the perfect recipe. You should at all times, keep your work to yourself!

To a new Alchemist this craft can seem like a considrible investment buts its worth it when you can make your accountant throw up slugs for paying you late.

To get started you will idealy need a few tools, although not all are necessayr, the most important tool is the Alembic. Other great items so start out with are:

1. Mortar and pestle

2. Retort

3. Crucible

A more advanced Alchemist might want to invest in an Athanor.

Some nice words, but what do they all mean? Well lets cover off all the tools of the trades along with some basic symbols and ingrediants.

### Equipment

| Item | Description |
|---|---|
| Alembic | The complete distilling apparatus consists of three parts: the "cucurbit", the still pot containing the liquid to be distilled, which is heated by a flame; the "head" or "cap" which fits over the mouth of the cucurbit to receive the vapors, with an attached downward-sloping "tube"; and the "receiver" container. In the case of another distilling vessel, the retort, the "cap" and the "cucurbit" have been combined to form a single vessel. The anbik is also called the raʾs (head) of the cucurbit. The liquid in the cucurbit is heated or boiled; the vapour rises into the anbik, where it cools by contact with the walls and condenses, running down the spout into the receiver.
| Mortar and pestle | Mortar and pestle is a set of two simple tools used since before light to the present day to prepare ingredients or substances by crushing and grinding them into a fine paste or powder. The mortar is characteristically a bowl, typically made of hard wood, metal or hard stone. The pestle is a blunt, club-shaped object. The substance to be ground, which may be wet or dry, is placed in the mortar where the pestle is pounded, pressed, and rotated into the substance until the desired texture is achieved.
| Retort | In a Alchemist laboratory, a retort is a device used for distillation or dry distillation of substances. It consists of a spherical vessel with a long downward-pointing neck. The liquid to be distilled is placed in the vessel and heated. The neck acts as a condenser, allowing the vapors to condense and flow along the neck to a collection vessel placed underneath.
| Crucible | A crucible is a stone or metal container in which metals or other substances may be melted or subjected to very high temperatures. It must be made from any material that can withstands temperatures high enough to melt or otherwise alter its contents.
| Athanor | In alchemy, an athanor is a furnace used to provide a uniform and constant heat for alchemical digestion. It is used for more advanced recipes that require a constant even tempreture.

### Basic Recipies

All of these recipes are good starts for beginner Alchemists, however it is suggest as is common practise that if you improve these recipes you find your own method of encoding... whatever that may be for you. The more complex a recipe the more complex the results are but the greater the risk of faluire. The better quality of the ingredient then that responding element will be stronger.

Here are some reccomended ingredients to create each element:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Element</th>
      <th>Combination</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td class="custom-font custom-font-push">Ea</td><td>Alchemists' powder or grinded Arenaria</td></tr>
      <tr><td class="custom-font custom-font-push">Ai</td><td>Bison grass & Blowball</td></tr>
      <tr><td class="custom-font custom-font-push">Fi</td><td>Charcol for direct or applied Heat for in-direct</td></tr>
      <tr><td class="custom-font custom-font-push">Wa</td><td>Alcohest or brewed Balisse fruit + water or just water</td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Here are some easy recipes:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Recipe</th>
      <th>Known Effect</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>Grind <span class="custom-font">Ea</span> & <span class="custom-font">Wa</span> then apply direct <span class="custom-font">Fi</span>, boil <span class="custom-font">Ti H</span> then distillate and add <span class="custom-font">Wa</span> </td><td>You regain 1d4 Hit Points when you drink this potion. Whatever its potency, the potion’s red liquid glimmers when agitated.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Grind <span class="custom-font">Ea</span>, <span class="custom-font">Wa</span> & <span class="custom-font">Fi</span> then apply direct <span class="custom-font">Fi</span>, boil <span class="custom-font">Ti Q</span> then distillate and add <span class="custom-font">Wa</span> & <span class="custom-font">Ea</span></td><td>For 1 hour after drinking it, you gain 4 temporary hit points that last for 1 hour. This blue potion bubbles and steams as if boiling.</td></tr>
    </tbody>

The rest is up to you, good luck. There are some good books you can buy however be careful. Some Alchemists sell fradulent recipes.
