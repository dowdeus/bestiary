Glengo & Co. is one of the oldest publishers around. They take pride on publishing content about the darkness and times before light. They class themselves as "hsitorians" documenting what has come before and have little intrest in what is to come after.

They are based in the small Empire town of leyowin on the east coast, it is here they have been largely responsible for the towns prosperity as travelers come to buy new publishings on launch days. Thanks to this they have earned themselves good relationships with local lords.

Notable achivements to date including winning the publisher of the cycle 4 times, the Empire roadrick charge and the elvish seal of writing.
